--- Original Description ---

Allows tailors to reclaim fabric from clothing. 
This is done based on the hitpoints of the apparel and the skill of the tailor. 
Highly skilled tailors will be able to reclaim more fabric and leather from tattered apparel. 
This replaces the 50% of stuff you would get back that is used in most salvage mods that simply set "smeltable" on apparel, which i find OP.
